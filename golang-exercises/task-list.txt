4. Task four is a simple calculator that can calculate the area,Diameter, and perimeter of
   circle. It can also calculate the area of a triangle. We basically used simple functions in
   the task-four.go file but to reduce lines of code and make it shorter we used high order
   functions to help simplify our code. the modified part of this code can be found in the 
   compare.go file in this directory.
   
5. Modify the following program to ask for a name and an age
   Modify the print statement accordingly
   
   package main
