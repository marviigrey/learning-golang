These are simple exercises that will help strengthen my hands in golang. Here is the link to the
repo where i found the excercise: "https://github.com/bregman-arie/go-exercises"
1. Write a go program that will store the values of your name and age in variables or constants and will print the variables you defined: My name is ___ and I'm ___ years old
You are delivering packages to customers. You hasve 100 packages to deliver.

2. Print the number of package you are going to deliver For example: "I have 100 packages to deliver"

You have delivered 20 packages. Print the remaining packages to deliver

The packages are going to be distributed equally between 4 customers. Print how many packages each customer receives (while mentioning the number of customers)

3. Display data types.

4. Task four is a simple calculator that can calculate the area,Diameter, and perimeter of
   circle. It can also calculate the area of a triangle. We basically used simple functions in
   the task-four.go file but to reduce lines of code and make it shorter we used high order
   functions to help simplify our code. the modified part of this code can be found in the 
   compare.go file in this directory.
   
5. Modify the following program to ask for a name and an age
   Modify the print statement accordingly
   
   package main

   import "fmt"

   func main() {
    fmt.Printf("Your name is ___ and your age is ___")
   }
   
Task-6: Using the time package, print The time now is: <TIME>
Using the math/rand package, generate random integer between 0 and 100
Using the math package calculate the square of 9.

task 7: Create an empty array of integers of size 10
Create an arrays of strings and fill it with 4 different strings
Can you mix different data types in one array?
You've created an empty array with the size of 10. Once declared can you add items to it? Can you add 50 items?
There is an array called 'games'. Assign the string "Donkey Kong" to the first place in the array
There is an array called "movies". Print the following:
The array itself
The second item in the array
The length of the array

task 8: Why do we need slices if we have arrays?
How to define an empty slice of strings called someSlice?
What the following lines does? append(someSlice, 'abc')
How to retrieve the first element of the slice someSlice?

task 9:
Create an empty map of string keys and string values called "profile".
Add the following data to the map
First Name (provided string)
Last Name (provided as string)
Age (provided as int)

task10: 
Write a loop to ask the name and age from a user and print 
"Your name is ___ and your age is ___ years old"
This should be infinite loop
Define the following array "pizza"}
Append to it the following item: "hamburger"
Append to it the following item: "salad"
Iterate over the list and print for each item Food: <Food name>. Make sure to replace <Food name> with item from the array
Define the following fixed array of 3 items: {square, circle, triangle}
Iterate over it and print for each item the following: This is <ITEM> and its index in the array is <INDEX>
